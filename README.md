## Branch 1 - HTML & CSS - Course Assignment

FED1 - HTML & CSS - Course Assignment

I went a bit overboard on the DES1 Course Assignment that we are meant to mimic in this assignment when it came to pop-ups and graphics etc., so I'll knock this page back a few steps so I can actually finish it. (also since JavaScript is needed)

All pop-ups have been replaced with their own temporary placeholder pages, but I've tried to keep the design aspect ish-the same.

Here's the Figma prototype for mobile:

And for desktop:

The site itself is available to see at: [larstp.github.io](https://larstp.github.io/)

NOTE: Some elements might not be centered correctly. This is because flexbox hates me. (also because I had to prioritise finishing the pages for the deadline) But I will continue to try and get it perfect.
