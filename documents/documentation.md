## FED1 - OCT24 - HTML & CSS - Course Assignment

I went a bit overboard on the DES1 Course Assignment that we are meant to mimic in this assignment when it came to pop-ups and graphics etc., so I'll knock this page back a few steps so I can actually finish it. (also since JavaScript is needed)

All pop-ups have been replaced with their own temporary placeholder pages, but I've tried to keep the design aspect ish-the same.

NOTE: Some elements might not be centered correctly. This is because flexbox hates me. (also because I had to prioritise finishing the pages for the deadline) But I will continue to try and get it perfect.

## Branch 2 - JavaScript - Course Assignment

FED1 - OCT24FT - JavaScript 1 - Course Assignment

In this assignment we added HTML dynamically using JavaScript and fetched all product information from NOROFF's API.
We created Product pages, shopping cart and checkout pages using JS, and implemented them on our webpage.
